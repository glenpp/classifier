Bayesian Classifier Classes for Perl, PHP and Python using Sqlite or MySQL

The aim of this is to provide a self-contained class for applying Bayes analysis of text (eg. SPAM filtering on a Blog) in multiple commonly used languages and with common databases so that the same algorithm can be used in a Language and Database agnostic manner. It's not the most efficient implementation, but is extremely easy to use and flexible.
